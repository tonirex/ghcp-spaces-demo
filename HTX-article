Here’s a concise summary of the key points from the HTX article titled **“Protecting our lifesavers: Improving firefighter safety with science”**:

---

## 🔥 Problem: Heavy CAF Backpacks Pose Injury Risk
- Firefighters use **Compressed Air Foam (CAF) backpacks** that weigh up to 25 kg.
- The original method of retrieving and donning them from Light Fire Attack Vehicles (LFAVs) involved bending, twisting, and lifting—leading to potential musculoskeletal injuries.
- The process often required two people and was time-consuming when done solo.

---

## 🧠 Solution: Ergonomic Redesign with Science
- HTX scientists and engineers collaborated with SCDF firefighters to redesign the backpack retrieval system.
- A **sliding tray** was installed in the LFAV rear compartment, allowing backpacks to be accessed at waist level.
- Firefighters can now slide the backpack out, tighten straps, and proceed—no bending or lifting required.

---

## 🧪 Research & Testing
- The team used **Digital Human Modelling (DHM)** software to simulate optimal tray height and posture.
- A pilot trial across four LFAVs showed **over 95% satisfaction** among firefighters.
- Final design enhancements included **gas springs** and **LED light strips** for usability and visibility.

---

## 🤝 Impact: Safer, Faster Deployment
- The redesign significantly improved safety, speed, and user experience.
- Firefighters directly contributed feedback, highlighting the value of frontline collaboration.
- The project exemplifies how **human factors engineering** can enhance operational safety in high-risk environments.
